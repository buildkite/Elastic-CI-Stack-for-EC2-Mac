# Elastic Mac for AWS

Run your Buildkite Builds on [AWS EC2 Mac instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-mac-instances.html)
using this CloudFormation template. This template creates an Auto Scaling
group, launch template, and host resource group to launch a pool of EC2 Mac
instances that run the Buildkite Agent. These agents can be used to run Buildkite
Pipelines and build Xcode based software projects for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS,
and watchOS.

## Elastic Mac for AWS is an experimental project üßë‚Äçüî¨üß™‚öóÔ∏è

As an experimental project, we will be regularly evaluating the adoption of this
feature. Issues and pull requests are welcome and encouraged. If we discontinue
the experiment due to lack of interest, we will provide guidance on migrating to
a supported solution.

Although this project is not under active development, we are interested in
learning from your experience using it. If you are experiencing issues, please
[open an Issue](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-mac-for-aws/issues/new) in this
repository, or contact [Buildkite Support](https://buildkite.com/support),
so that we can work together on a solution.

# Set-up instructions
