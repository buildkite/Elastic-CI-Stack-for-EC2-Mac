# elastic-mac-for-aws

Run your Buildkite Builds on AWS `mac1.metal` using this CloudFormation
template. This template creates an Auto Scaling group, Launch Template, and Host
Resource Group suitable for maintaining a pool of EC2 `mac1.metal` instances
that run the Buildkite Agent. These agents can be used to run Buildkite
Pipelines and build Xcode based software projects for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS,
and watchOS.

learning from your experience using it. If you are experiencing issues, please
